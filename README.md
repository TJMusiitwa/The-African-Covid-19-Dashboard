### Foreword
Hello and welcome, you might be wondering "oh great" another dashboard and yes you are right it is however, the prime focus of this dashboard is as stated in the title to mainly visualize an overview of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic as it relates to the African continent.

This dashboard was built with Python using [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/), with charts made in [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) and the Flatly theme of the app provided by [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/).
 The code behind the dashboard  is available [here](github.com).
